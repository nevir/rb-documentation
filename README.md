Ruby Documentation Project
==========================

Ruby is such a fantastic language, but why doesn't it have equally fantastic
documentation?


What's This All About?
----------------------

You probably want to [read the motivation](contributing/Motivation.md) behind
this project to understand where we're coming from.  However, the TL;DR is that
we want to make Ruby the easiest language to learn and understand, from novice
through expert.


How Can I Help?
---------------

First, make sure you understand [the documentation file syntax](contributing/Documentation Format.md),
as well as the [written style guide](contributing/Style Guide.md).

Then, just dive in and pick a portion of Ruby that you're passionate about;
there's plenty to go around!
